### Best Practices

**Code Style**
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for writing clean, readable Python code.

**PEP 8 Tools**
- Use tools like `black` for automatic code formatting and `flake8` for linting to check for code quality issues.

**Version Control**
- Use Git for version control to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your project.

**Virtual Environments**
- Use `venv` or `virtualenv` to create isolated environments, preventing dependency conflicts between projects.
  - `python -m venv myenv`: Create a virtual environment.
  - `source myenv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `myenv\Scripts\activate` (Windows): Activate the virtual environment.
  - `deactivate`: Deactivate the virtual environment.
