# TYPE CASTING 
'''
Typecasting (type conversion) is the proces of converting one data type to another
Python supports several built-in functions for typecasting

int(): Converts a value to an integer.
float(): Converts a value to a float.
str(): Converts a value to a string.
bool(): Converts a value to a boolean.

# Converting float to int
x = 3.99
y = int(x)  # y will be 3 (floats are truncated when cast to int)

# Converting int to float
z = float(10)  # z will be 10.0

# Converting int to string
a = str(123)  # a will be '123'

# Converting string to int
b = int("45")  # b will be 45

# Boolean conversion
is_valid = bool(1)  # True (non-zero values are True)
is_empty = bool(0)  # False (0 is False)
