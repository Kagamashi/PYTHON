Task approach:
    1. Read problem twice to understand it
    2. Try thinking of different ways to solve the problem
    3. Think E2E of best solution based on complexity
    4. Write algorithm from patterns in drawing
    5. Code it out
    6. Try to improve it 
    7. Go through different solutions (even if answered correctly)
