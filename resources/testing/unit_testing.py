'''
Unit testing is a way to test individual units of code (functions,methods) to ensure they work as expected.
  unittest: Built-in Python module for testing.
  pytest: A more advanced and flexible testing framework that provides additional features
'''

''' unittest module is Python built-in testing framework
test cases are written as classes that inherit from unittest.TestCase 
individual tests are defined as methods whose names begin with test_
  setUp(): Optional method that runs before each test.
  tearDown(): Optional method that runs after each test.
  assert methods to check test results

        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

        self.assertEqual(add(-2, -3), -5)

''' pytest is another popular testing framework that simplifies test writing and offers more functionality compared to unittest
  Functions for test cases are written with the prefix test_.
  You donâ€™t need to create a class, making it more concise.
